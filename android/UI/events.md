## How do we add events to our user interface Views?

The absence of user interface events will leave apps as static, read only screens

Can react to: 

- Changing the current UI in some way

- Changing the data

- Performing some action (eg. navigating to another part of the app)

- Provide feedback to the user

Some are inbuilt, such as buttons

**Types of events**

- onClick()

- onLongClick()

- onTouch()

These events are always triggered
