# Relational model

➢Data is stored in tables (relations) 

➢Each relation consists of rows and columns 

➢Each relation must have a unique name, a header and body (the header = schema, the body  = instance) 

➢The header is the list of columns in the relation 

➢A relation may contain an identifying column(s) (primary key) 

➢Keys are used for unique row identification and for establishing relationships between tables 

➢A set of rules (integrity constraints) enforces data integrity 

➢Data normalisation ensures effective data storage and processing
