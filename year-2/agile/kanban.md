• Pull work if current WIP < WIP limit

## Properties

1. Visualize workflow

2. Limit work in progress

3. Measure and manage flow

4. Make process policies explicit

5. Use models to improve the process

## Reduce WIP Deliver Often

• The quantity of work in progress is directly related
to lead time ( WIP ↑ - LT ↑ )

• The quality of work done is inversely related to
lead time ( LT ↑ - QUAL ↓ )
