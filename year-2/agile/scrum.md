## Cynefin

## Roles

- Product owner

- Scrum master

- Development team

## Key points

- Backlog is groomed so that it is prioritised

- Sprint planning, pull from top of backlog into scrum backlog

- Each feature is broken into a set of tasks

## Daily scrum

1. What did I do  yesterday

2. What will I do today

3. What is blocking me?

## Last reponsible moment

When to make descisions. Decide as late as possible

## Cost of change

Changes should be minor as you made the rigth descisions sooner

## Small batch size

- Reduced cycle time

- Reduced flow variablity

- Accelerated feedback

- Reduced risk

- Reduced overheada

- Increased motivation and urgency

- Reduced cost and schedual growth

## Definition of done?

What constitutes as done

- Developed

- Documentation updated

- Tested

- In production

## Benefits of time boxing

- Establishes a WIP limit

- Forces prioritisation

- Demonstrates progress

- Avoids unnecessary perfectionism

- Motivates closure

- Improves predictability


## Benefits of short duration

- Ease of planning

- Fast feedback

- Bounded error

- Imporved return n investment

- Rejuvenated excitement

- Frequent checkpoints

## Technical debt

- Code refactored

- Code in standard format

- Code is commented

- Code is checked in

- Code has been inspected

## Testing

- Unit tested

- Integration

- Regression

- Platform

- Language

## User stories

As a <user story> I want to <goal> so that <benefit>

Acceptance criteria

Can add conditions of satisfaction

### I.N.V.E.S.T

*In test*

Independent- Story is self-contained

Negotiable- Story can be changed until in sprint

Valuable- Story must deliver value to customer

Estimable- Story must have estimated effort

Small- Story must be acieveable in sprint

Testable- Story must include test criteria

### Technical improvement

### Non fucntional requirements

## D.E.E.P

- Detailed Appropriately- PBI is well-defined

- Emergent- PBI can be changed until in sprint

- Estimated- PBI must have estimated effort

- Prioritised- PBI near-term items in order. Can develop a release plan form the priorited backlog.

## Definition of ready

- Business value is clearly articulated

- Details are sufficiently understood

- Dependencies are identified- no blockers

- Acceptance criteria are clear and testable

- Performace criteria are clear and testable

- Demonstratable at sprint review meeting


## Estimating

Too much effort in estimating causes a diminishing accuracy in the estimated. Estimate descisions should be made quickly. Come to a rough agreement on the effort needed to be put into. 

## Planning poker

- Consensus based

- Expert opinion

- Intense discussion

- Relative sizing

- Accurate grouping/ binning

- Leverage estimating history

1. PO selects PBI and reads it to the dev team

2. Dev team discusses and asks PO questions

3. Devs each privately select a poker card

4. Devs simultaneously share their poker cards

5. If all cards same then consensus

6. If not all same then discuss and repeat

## Product owner responsibilities

- Manage economics

- Participate in planning

- Groom the product backlog

- Define acceptance criteria and verify met

- Collaborate with development team

- Collaborate with stakeholders

- Domain skills...

- People skills...

- Descision making...

## Scrum masters

- Coach

- Servant leader

- Process authority

- Interference shield

- Impediment remover

- Change agent

- Knowledgeable

- Questioning

- Patient

- Collaborative

- Protective

- Transparant

## Scrum of scrums

A representative of each scrum team will get togther to talk about hwo their team is getting on

## Planning inputs

**Product backlog

Prior to sprint planning, the topmost product backlog items have
been groomed into a ready state

**Team velocity 

The team’s historical velocity is an indicator of how much work is
practical for the team to complete in a sprint

**Constraints 

Business or technical constraints that could materially affect what
the team can deliver are identified

**Team capabilities

Capabilities take into account which people are on the team, what
skills each team member has, and how available each person will
be in the upcoming sprint

**Initial sprint goal

This is the business goal the product owner would like to see
accomplished during this sprint

## Sprint capacity

How much the team is capable of doing within a sprint.

Sprint buffer

Capacity to work

Personal time off

Other non sprint commitments

Other sprint activities

**Use daily scrum meeting rather than standup**

## Technical practices

• Test-driven development

• Refactoring

• Simple design

• Pair programming

• Continuous integration

• Collective code ownership

• Coding standard

• Metaphor

## Sprint review

**Scrum team 

The product owner, scrum master, and development team should
all be present so that they can all hear the same feedback and be
able to answer any questions regarding the sprint and the product
increment

**Internal stakeholders

Business owners, executives, and managers should see the
progress first-hand so that they can suggest course corrections.
For internal product development, internal users, subject matter
experts, and the operations manager of the business function to
which the product relates should attend

**Other internal teams

Sales, marketing, support, legal, compliance, and other scrum and
non-scrum development teams might want to attend sprint
reviews to provide area-specific feedback or to sync their own
groups work with the scrum team

**External stakeholders

External customers, users, and partners can provide valuable
feedback to he scrum team and other attendees

### review Prep

• Determine who to invite

• Schedule the activity

• Confirm that the sprint work is done

• Prepare for the demonstration

• Determine who does what

### Retrospective prep

• Define the retrospective focus

• Select the exercises

• Gather objective data

• Structure the retrospective


1. What worked well this sprint that we want to
continue doing

2. What didn’t work well this sprint that we should
stop doing

3. What should we start doing or improve

End up getting a shared perspective on how to improve the situation

Could track develoer happiness over the sprint

### Retrospective issues

• Not doing the retrospective or low attendance

• All fluff, no stuff

• Ignoring the elephant in the room

• Poor facilitator

• Depressing and energy draining

• Blame game

• Complaint session

• Replaces ad hoc process improvement

• Too ambitious

• No follow-through
