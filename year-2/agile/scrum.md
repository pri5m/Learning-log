## Key points

- Backlog is groomed so that it is prioritised

- Sprint planning, pull from top of backlog into scrum backlog

- Each feature is broken into a set of tasks

## Daily scrum

1. What did I do  yesterday

2. What will I do today

3. What is blocking me?

## Last reponsible moment

When to make descisions. Decide as late as possible

## Cost of change

Changes should be minor as you made the rigth descisions sooner

## Small batch size

- Reduced cycle time

- Reduced flow variablity

- Accelerated feedback

- Reduced risk

- Reduced overheada

- Increased motivation and urgency

## D.E.E.P

- Detailed Appropriately- PBI is well-defined

- Emergent- PBI can be changed until in sprint

- Estimated- PBI must have estimated effort

- Prioritised- PBI near-term items in order. Can develop a release plan form the priorited backlog.

## Definition of ready

- Business value is clearly articulated

- Details are sufficiently understood

- Dependencies are identified- no blockers

- Acceptance criteria are clear and testable

- Performace criteria are clear and testable

- Demonstratable at sprint review meeting


## Estimating

Too much effort in estimating causes a diminishing accuracy in the estimated. Estimate descisions should be made quickly. Come to a rough agreement on the effort needed to be put into. 

## Planning poker

- Consensus based

- Expert opinion

- Intense discussion

- Relative sizing

- Accurate grouping/ binning

- Leverage estimating history

1. PO selects PBI and reads it to the dev team

2. Dev team discusses and asks PO questions

3. Devs each privately select a poker card

4. Devs simultaneously share their poker cards

5. If all cards same then consensus

6. If not all same then discuss and repeat
