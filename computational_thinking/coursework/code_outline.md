# Link to the trick- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b94xSqTb_zY

# Represent the deck of cards
# Create a list containing the deck of cards

# Ask the user to select a card
# Remove two queens from the list

# Shuffle
# Pick out 13 cards at random to create a new deck (create a new list? use function)
# user input from the deck of 13 cards (maybe include a check?)
# keep track of this card (put in a separate list?)

# Shuffle the deck
# Remind the user that the card is between the two red queens (yt 0.49)
# keep the tracked card at the bottom of the deck

# Select cards and place them at the end of a deck
# put the 13 cards(12 unknown, 1 tracked) inbetween the two queens, show a representation
# the tracked card should be second to last in the deck, above the queen at the very bottom of the deck

# Then deal using the words "BETWEEN THE TWO RED QUEENS"
# Show the list being systematically shuffled
# The tracked card should end up being sandwiched between the two queens

# At the end, you should demonstrate that the selected card is between the two queens
# Display the hidden list and then show that the hidden card is th eusers card and was between the two queens

# EXTRA: Allow the trick to be demonstrated with different words
# EXTRA: Allow the trick to be shown from the beginning( with the deck reshuffled),
# asking at the end whether they want to continue or not
