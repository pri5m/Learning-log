Commenting code- why? Why you made that decision, time limited? alternatives? 

**Abstraction**

Abstraction focuses upon the essential characteristics of some object, relative to the perspective of the viewer

What are we actually worried about in the comtext of the application.

Consider the problem from different perspectives

Think bottom-up and top-down- The smallest parts and the overall goal

Consider the events that will change the domain

Challenge your abstractions early and often- Don't get stuck over-thinking your model

**Encapsulation**

Access and hiding

The method by which internal details are hidden from external use

Shell, things going on that can only be accessed by external methods

Encapsulation hides the details of the implementation of an object

- They remove what is unnecessary and hide internal workings

**Decomposition and collaboration**

Abstraction and encapdrive the decomposition

Once broken down, the solution requires the parts to work together (collaborate)

eg. a thermometer collaborates with a heating controller to provide the behaviour of a thermostat

**Cohesion**

The amount by which elements of  component belong together

Would you combine a thermostat with a doorbell?

- Better " to do one thing and to do it well"- The UNIX philosophy

Design is often (not always) about trade-offs

Make your trade offs informed

- If you have to commit early, make them reversable
