2. Try doing this: help(ex25) and also help(ex25.break_words). Notice how you get help for your module, and how the help is those odd """ strings you put after each function in ex25? Those special strings are called documentation comments and we'll be seeing more of them.
```
>>> help(ex25)

3. Typing ex25. is annoying. A shortcut is to do your import like this: from ex25 import * which is like saying, "Import everything from ex25." Programmers like saying things backward. Start a new session and see how all your functions are right there.

4. Try breaking your file and see what it looks like in python when you use it. You will have to quit python with quit() to be able to reload it.
```
>>> print_first_words(words0
... print_first_words(words)
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print_first_words(words)
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
    
*How can the words.pop function change the words variable?*

That's a complicated question, but in this case words is a list, and because of that you can give it commands and it'll retain the results of those commands. This is similar to how files and many other things worked when you were working with them.

*When should I print instead of return in a function?*

The return from a function gives the line of code that called the function a result. You can think of a function as taking input through its arguments, and returning output through return. The print is completely unrelated to this, and only deals with printing output to the terminal.
