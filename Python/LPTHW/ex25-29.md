2. Try doing this: help(ex25) and also help(ex25.break_words). Notice how you get help for your module, and how the help is those odd """ strings you put after each function in ex25? Those special strings are called documentation comments and we'll be seeing more of them.

3. Typing ex25. is annoying. A shortcut is to do your import like this: from ex25 import * which is like saying, "Import everything from ex25." Programmers like saying things backward. Start a new session and see how all your functions are right there.

4. Try breaking your file and see what it looks like in python when you use it. You will have to quit python with quit() to be able to reload it.
```
>>> print_first_words(words0
... print_first_words(words)
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print_first_words(words)
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
    
*How can the words.pop function change the words variable?*

That's a complicated question, but in this case words is a list, and because of that you can give it commands and it'll retain the results of those commands. This is similar to how files and many other things worked when you were working with them.

*When should I print instead of return in a function?*

The return from a function gives the line of code that called the function a result. You can think of a function as taking input through its arguments, and returning output through return. The print is completely unrelated to this, and only deals with printing output to the terminal.

# ex27: Memorising logic
**The Truth Terms**
In Python we have the following terms (characters and phrases) for determining if something is "True" or "False." Logic on a computer is all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some variables is True at that point in the program.

* and
* or
* not
* != (not equal)
* == (equal)
* >= (greater-than-equal)
* <= (less-than-equal)
* True
* False

The Truth Tables

We will now use these characters to make the truth tables you need to memorize.

| **NOT | True?** |
|----|--------|
| not False |	True |
| not True |	False |


| **OR	| True?** |
|--------|-------|
| True or False	| True |
| True or True	| True |
| False or True	| True |
| False or False	| False |


| **AND	| True?** |
|-------|-------|
| True and False	| False |
| True and True	| True |
| False and True	| False |
| False and False	| False |


| **NOT OR	| True?** |
|--------|---------|
| not (True or False)	| False |
| not (True or True)	| False |
| not (False or True)	| False |
| not (False or False)	| True |


| **NOT AND	| True?** |
|-------|-------|
| not (True and False)	| True |
| not (True and True)	| False |
| not (False and True)	| True |
| not (False and False)	| True |


| **!=	| True?** |
|---------|--------|
| 1 != 0	| True |
| 1 != 1	| False |
| 0 != 1	| True |
| 0 != 0	| False |


| **==	| True?** |
|-------|--------|
| 1 == 0	| False |
| 1 == 1	| True |
| 0 == 1	| False |
| 0 == 0	| True |

!= Means not equal to

== Means equal to

I scored 20/20! :blush:

Whenever you see these boolean logic statements, you can solve them easily by this simple process:

1. Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
2. Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
3. Find each not and invert it.
4. Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
5. When you are done you should have True or False.

*Why does "test" and "test" return "test" or 1 and 1 return 1 instead of True?*

Python and many languages like to return one of the operands to their boolean expressions rather than just True or False. This means that if you did False and 1 you get the first operand (False) but if you do True and 1 your get the second (1). Play with this a bit.

*Is there any difference between != and <>?*

Python has deprecated <> in favor of !=, so use !=. Other than that there should be no difference.

*Isn't there a shortcut?*

Yes. Any and expression that has a False is immediately False, so you can stop there. Any or expression that has a True is immediately True, so you can stop there. But make sure that you can process the whole expression because later it becomes helpful.
