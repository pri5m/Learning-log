# Ex0: The setup
**Powershell**

mkdir______     eg. mkdir PythonPracticeProject
    
    to create a folder

cd_____     eg. cd PythonPracticeProject
    
    open PythonPacticeProject
  
 dir
    
    check the content of the folder
  
 cd..
    
    Return to the folder above the one you are currently in
  
*Use tab to autocomplete words*

*Use up arrow to retieve the line above*

# Ex1: A good first program
```python
print "Hello world"
print "I like printing."
print "Yay! Printing."
print 'Blub "Yay!" Smush'
print "I'd like to read a book now."
print "#Hey!"
print #"Lol"
# print "Hey!"
```
End file name in '.py' so python works well

Save work- blue dot in tab if there is unsaved work. Ctrl + s to save

python ex1.py in terminal to run it

# Ex2: Comments
```python
#
print '#lol'
```
pound symbol

'#lol' in a string so is not commented out

*Read code backwards to pick up errors*

# Ex3: Numbers and maths
```python
print "I will now count my chickens:"

print "Hen", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "What is 3 + 2", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's false."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
```
**Output**
```
I will now count my chickens:
Hen 30
Roosters 97
Now I will count the eggs:
7
Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?
False
What is 3 + 2 5
What is 5 - 7? -2
Oh, that's why it's false.
How about some more.
Is it greater? True
Is it greater or equal? True
Is it less or equal? False
```
<= less than   >= greater than

floating point number: A number with a decimal point eg. 4.0

*Don't forget to use print with sums*

# Ex4: Variables and names
``` python
cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

print "There are", cars, "cars avaliable."
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "passengers today."
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car"
```
= assigns a value to something

== tests to see if two things have the same value

*Use spaces eg. x = 100 NOT x=100, this is bad form*
