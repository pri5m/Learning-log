# ex11: Asking questions
raw_input() (don't forget brackets)

Gets input from the user and returns the data input by the user in a string

```python
print "How old are you?", #comma used so user input is on the same line as question
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you gain weight?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
age, height, weight)
```
x = int(raw_input())

Converts the string into a number

# ex12: Prompting people
```python
age = raw_input("How old are you?")
height = raw_input("How tall are you?")
weight = raw_input("How much do you weigh?")

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." %(
age, height, weight
)
