# ex11: Asking questions
raw_input() (don't forget brackets)

Gets input from the user and returns the data input by the user in a string

```python
print "How old are you?", #comma used so user input is on the same line as question
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you gain weight?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
age, height, weight)
```
x = int(raw_input())

Converts the string into a number

# ex12: Prompting people
```python
age = raw_input("How old are you?")
height = raw_input("How tall are you?")
weight = raw_input("How much do you weigh?")

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." %(
age, height, weight
)
```
Pydoc is a help module for python- Use in powershell (terminal)

python -m pydoc <function>
    
eg.  python -m pydoc open
    
# ex13: Parameters, unpacking and variables
argv 'argument variable'- holds the argument you pass to your python script when you run it

argv then gets 'unpacked'- each word assigned to a variable in the order its written in the script
```python
from sys import argv

script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third
```
**output**
```
PS C:\Users\Holly\PythonPracticeProject> python ex13.py Cat Dog guinea_pig    #inputing the argv values in the command line
The script is called: ex13.py
Your first variable is: Cat
Your second variable is: Dog
Your third variable is: guinea_pig
```
**Error** *Wrote 'scrip' insted of 'script' so 'script' was not defined

*Good idea to define script in the = argv bit as it counts the script title as a argv*

# ex14: prompting and passing
```python
from sys import argv

script, user_name, second = argv
prompt = '>>>'

print "Hi %s, I'm the %s script." % (user_name, script)
print "I'd like to ask you a few questions %s." % user_name
print "Do you like me %s?" % user_name
likes = raw_input (prompt) #Puts the prompt '>>>' infront of user input

print "Where do you live %s?" % user_name
lives = raw_input (prompt)

print "What kind of computer do you hve?"
computer = raw_input (prompt)

print "Do you like %s or not?" % second
like2 = raw_input (prompt)

print """
Alright, so you said %r about liking me.
you live in %r. Not sure what that is.
And you have a %r computer. Nice.
You have said %r about liking %r
""" % (likes, lives, computer, like2, second)
