# ex15: Reading files
**ex15_sample.txt**
``` python
This is stuff I typed into a file
It is really cool stuff
Lots and lots of fun to have in here
```
**ex15.py**
```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv # filename is ex15_sample.txt

txt = open(filename) # var (txt) of opening the file (defined in argv)

print "Here's your file %r:" % filename # The modulus inserts the script name into a string
print txt.read() #Displays the text from the ex15_sample.txt script

print "Type the filename again:"
file_again = raw_input("> ") #User input with ">" as a prompt

txt_again = open(file_again) #Open command within a new var- txt_again

print txt_again.read() #Displays and 'reads' the txt_again var
```
Open- Command. Like raw_input, it takes a parameter and returns a value you an set to your own variable.
It opens a file, in this case ex15_sample.txt

# ex16: Reading and writing files
```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv # defining argv

print "We're going to erase %r." % filename #use of a modulo in a sting
print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

raw_input("?") #User inputs response next to a ? mark

print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, 'w') #Use of 'w' means- open this file in write mode

print "Truncating the file. Goodbye!"
target.truncate() #Empties the file

print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines:"

line1 = raw_input("Line 1:") #User inputs three lines
line2 = raw_input("Line 2:")
line3 = raw_input("Line 3:")

print "I'm going to write these to the file"

#target.write(line1)
#target.write("\n")
#target.write(line2)
#target.write("\n")
#target.write(line3)
#target.write("\n")

target.write('line1\nline2\nline3\n') #Short version of the above block

print "And finally, we close it."
target.close() #Closes the file and saves it to the disc
```
**Error** *left out 'print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines:" ' from the code*

'w' for write a file 'r' for read a file and 'a' for append a file

Can use a '+' modifier eg. 'w+','r+','a+' to open in multiple modes

**Output**
```
$ python ex16.py test.txt
We're going to erase 'test.txt'.
If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).
If you do want that, hit RETURN.
?
Opening the file...
Truncating the file.  Goodbye!
Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.
line 1:  Mary had a little lamb
line 2:  Its fleece was white as snow
line 3:  It was also tasty
I'm going to write these to the file.
And finally, we close it.
```
