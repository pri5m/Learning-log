# ex15: Reading files
**ex15_sample.txt**
``` python
This is stuff I typed into a file
It is really cool stuff
Lots and lots of fun to have in here
```
**ex15.py**
```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv # filename is ex15_sample.txt

txt = open(filename) # var (txt) of opening the file (defined in argv)

print "Here's your file %r:" % filename # The modulus inserts the script name into a string
print txt.read() #Displays the text from the ex15_sample.txt script

print "Type the filename again:"
file_again = raw_input("> ") #User input with ">" as a prompt

txt_again = open(file_again) #Open command within a new var- txt_again

print txt_again.read() #Displays and 'reads' the txt_again var
```
Open- Command. Like raw_input, it takes a parameter and returns a value you an set to your own variable.
It opens a file, in this case ex15_sample.txt
