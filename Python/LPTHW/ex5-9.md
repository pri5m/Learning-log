# ex5: More variables
``` python
name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = round(74.7) #inches
weight = 180 #lbs
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d inches tall" % height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (age,
height, weight, age + height + weight)

% -modulus

Substitutes a variable into a string

round()- Command that rounds decimals (floating point numbers)

# ex6: Strings and text
``` python
x = "There are %d types of people." % 10 #inserts 10
binary = "binary" #creates a variable
do_not = "don't" #creates a variable
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s" % (binary, do_not)
# inserts 2 string variables into a string to form one complete string
print x
print y

print "I said: %r." % x #inserts variable x which in turn has had an integer inserted
print "I also said: '%s'." % y # ditto but 2 strings not an integer

hilarious = False #assigns a boolean value to a variable
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r" # Creates a variable that will
#use the hilarious variable. Without the %r it will not work later

print joke_evaluation % hilarious # the % hilarious will be assigned to the %r in the
#joke_evaluation string.
# the output of lines 12, 13 and 16 will be -> Isn't that joke so funny?! False

w = "This is the left side of..." #a string assigned to a variable
e = "a string with a right side." # ditto

print w + e # the + is used to combine the two variables with assigned strings into one string
```
%r is best used for debugging

%s and %d is best for displaying variables to users
