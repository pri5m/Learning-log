print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d inches tall" % height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (age,
height, weight, age + height + weight)
'''
% -modulus

Substitutes a variable into a string

round()- Command that rounds decimals (floating point numbers)

# ex6: Strings and text
```python
x = "There are %d types of people." % 10 #inserts 10
binary = "binary" #creates a variable
do_not = "don't" #creates a variable
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s" % (binary, do_not)
#inserts 2 string variables into a string to form one complete string
print x
print y

print "I said: %r." % x #inserts variable x which in turn has had an integer inserted
print "I also said: '%s'." % y # ditto but 2 strings not an integer

hilarious = False #assigns a boolean value to a variable
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r" # Creates a variable that will
#use the hilarious variable. Without the %r it will not work later

print joke_evaluation % hilarious # the % hilarious will be assigned to the %r in the
#joke_evaluation string.
#the output of lines 12, 13 and 16 will be -> Isn't that joke so funny?! False

w = "This is the left side of..." #a string assigned to a variable
e = "a string with a right side." # ditto

print w + e # the + is used to combine the two variables with assigned strings into one string
```
%r is best used for debugging

%s and %d is best for displaying variables to users

# ex7: More printing
```python
print "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Its fleese was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 #prints the string 10 times

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
#The comma is used so that the string prints on the same line even
#though there are two print commands
```
*Python lines should be no longer than 80 characters to make reading it easier, separate onto a new line by using a comma*

# ex8: Printing, printing
```python
formatter = "%r %r %r %r" #A variable consisting of 4 formatters

print formatter % (1, 2, 3, 4,)
print formatter % ("one", "two", "three", "four")
print formatter % (True, False, False, True)
print formatter % (formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter)
print formatter % (
    "I had this thing.",
    "That you could type right.",
    "But it didn't sing.",
    "So I said goodnight."
)
```
Can have a formatter and formatter

Converts "" to'' on output if no ' in string

# ex9: Printing, printing, printing
```python
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months", months

print """
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
"""
```
\n new line, use within a single string. Use infront of part to be on new line

Use """ (no spaces) allows for a block of text to be written as one string
