# ex30: Else and if
```python
people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:   #If the if statement is not true , it will then go to elif (else if). If this statement is not true then it will run else
    print "We should not take the cars"
else:
    print "We cant't decide."

if trucks > cars:
    print "That's too many trucks."
else:
    print "We still can't decide."

if people > trucks:
    print "Alright, let's just take th trucks."
else:
    print "Fine, let's stay at home then."
```
**Note** Remember the colon!

*What happens if multiple elif blocks are True?*

Python starts and the top runs the first block that is True, so it will run only the first one.

# ex31: Making decisions
```python
print "You enter a dark room with two doors. Do you go through door #1 or door #2?"

door = raw_input("> ")

if bear == "1":
    print "There's a giant bear here eating cheese cake. What do you do?"
    print "1. Take the cake."
    print "2. Scream at the bear."

    bear = raw_input("> ")

    if bear == "1":
        print "The bear eats your face off. Good job!"
    elif bear == "2":
        print "The bear eats your leg off. Good job!"
    else:
        print "Well, doing %s is probably better. Bear runs away." % bear

elif door == "2":
    print "You stare into the endless abyss at Cthulhu's retina."
    print "1. Blueberries."
    print "2. Yellow jacket clothespins."
    print "3. Understanding revolovers yelling melodies."

    insanity = raw_input("> ")

    if insanity == "1" or insanity == "2":
        print "Your body survives powered by a mind of jello. Good job!"
    else:
        print "The insanity rots your eyes into a pool of muck. Good job!"

else:
    print "You stumble around and fall on a knife and die. Good job!"
```
A key point here is that you are now putting the if-statements inside if-statements as code that can run. This is very powerful and can be used to create "nested" decisions, where one branch leads to another and another.

**Common student questions**

*Can you replace elif with a sequence of if-else combinations?*

You can in some situations, but it depends on how each if/else is written. It also means that Python will check every if-else combination, rather than just the first false ones like it would with if-elif-else. Try to make some of these to figure out the differences.

*How do I tell if a number is between a range of numbers?*

You have two options: Use 0 < x < 10 or 1 <= x < 10, which is classic notation, or use x in range(1, 10).

*What if I wanted more options in the if-elif-else blocks?*

Add more elif blocks for each possible choice.

**My choose your own adventure**
```python
print "Welcome to the haunted mansion *spooky noises*"
print "Do you wish to enter through the 1. front door or 2. the backdoor?"

door = raw_input("> ")

if door == "1":
    print "You eyes slowly adjust to the gloom as you set foot into a dark room."
    print "1. Investigate the box that is sat in the corner of the room"
    print "2. Turn around and exit through the door you entered"

    box = raw_input("> ")

    if box == "1":
        print "You cautiouly lift up the lid of the box."
        print "A strange wailing sound floats up from the box."
        print "You scream and run out the house."
    else:
        print "You narrow your eyes whilst staring at the box and decide to leave."

elif door == "2":
    print "A long, narrow hallway appears infront of you. You take a deep breath."
    print "1. Go upstairs"
    print "2. Try a door that is at the end of the hallway"

    direction = raw_input("> ")

    if direction == "1":
        print "The stairs creek as you walk up and you grip onto the banister tightly."
        print "You notice a dusty torch on the floor at the top of the stairs."
        print "1. Pick up the torch and keep walking"
        print "2. Leave the torch where it is and keep walking"

        torch = raw_input("> ")

        if torch == "1":
            print "You hit the torch and it flickers on, emitting a dull glow."
            print "You shine it around the corridor and that's when you notice a dark shadowy figure."
            print "You make a run for it but trip and twist your ankle."
            print "You pull yourself up and bolt for the exit."
            print "The door closes behind you just as the shadowy figure slams into it. You are safe."
        elif torch == "2":
            print "You keep walking in the gloom and bump into a tall figure infront of you."
            print "The figure screams and hits you over the head."
            print "You crumple onto the ground, dead."
        else:
            print "You turn around to walk back down the stairs but realise that your exit is blocked by a tall shadowy figure."
            print "You scream and the figure laughs. That was the last thing you ever saw."

    elif direction == "2":
        print "You try the door handle but the door won't budge"
        print "You turn around slowly as you hear heavy breathing."
        print "The walls melt away and you fall back, hitting your head on the handle."
        print "A cackling sound comes from near your head. You black out."
    else:
        print "You try another room but fall trough a hole in the floor."
        print "Your leg is broken and you can't move. Oh dear."

else:
    print "A spooky voice floats out from the house."
    print "\"You will regret this decision and be haunted 'till the end of time.\""
```
**Mistake** Needed to put numbers in ""- This is because raw_input produces a string even if the input is a 'number' Therefore the value in the function also needs to be in a string unless the raw_input has been converted from a string to a number

**Mistake** Spelling
