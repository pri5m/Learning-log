# ex30: Else and if
```python
people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:   #If the if statement is not true , it will then go to elif (else if). If this statement is not true then it will run else
    print "We should not take the cars"
else:
    print "We cant't decide."

if trucks > cars:
    print "That's too many trucks."
else:
    print "We still can't decide."

if people > trucks:
    print "Alright, let's just take th trucks."
else:
    print "Fine, let's stay at home then."
```
**Note** Remember the colon!

*What happens if multiple elif blocks are True?*

Python starts and the top runs the first block that is True, so it will run only the first one.
