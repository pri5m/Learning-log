# ex30: Else and if
```python
people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:   #If the if statement is not true , it will then go to elif (else if). If this statement is not true then it will run else
    print "We should not take the cars"
else:
    print "We cant't decide."

if trucks > cars:
    print "That's too many trucks."
else:
    print "We still can't decide."

if people > trucks:
    print "Alright, let's just take th trucks."
else:
    print "Fine, let's stay at home then."
```
**Note** Remember the colon!

*What happens if multiple elif blocks are True?*

Python starts and the top runs the first block that is True, so it will run only the first one.

# ex31: Making decisions
```python
print "You enter a dark room with two doors. Do you go through door #1 or door #2?"

door = raw_input("> ")

if bear == "1":
    print "There's a giant bear here eating cheese cake. What do you do?"
    print "1. Take the cake."
    print "2. Scream at the bear."

    bear = raw_input("> ")

    if bear == "1":
        print "The bear eats your face off. Good job!"
    elif bear == "2":
        print "The bear eats your leg off. Good job!"
    else:
        print "Well, doing %s is probably better. Bear runs away." % bear

elif door == "2":
    print "You stare into the endless abyss at Cthulhu's retina."
    print "1. Blueberries."
    print "2. Yellow jacket clothespins."
    print "3. Understanding revolovers yelling melodies."

    insanity = raw_input("> ")

    if insanity == "1" or insanity == "2":
        print "Your body survives powered by a mind of jello. Good job!"
    else:
        print "The insanity rots your eyes into a pool of muck. Good job!"

else:
    print "You stumble around and fall on a knife and die. Good job!"
```
A key point here is that you are now putting the if-statements inside if-statements as code that can run. This is very powerful and can be used to create "nested" decisions, where one branch leads to another and another.

**Common student questions**

*Can you replace elif with a sequence of if-else combinations?*

You can in some situations, but it depends on how each if/else is written. It also means that Python will check every if-else combination, rather than just the first false ones like it would with if-elif-else. Try to make some of these to figure out the differences.

*How do I tell if a number is between a range of numbers?*

You have two options: Use 0 < x < 10 or 1 <= x < 10, which is classic notation, or use x in range(1, 10).

*What if I wanted more options in the if-elif-else blocks?*

Add more elif blocks for each possible choice.
