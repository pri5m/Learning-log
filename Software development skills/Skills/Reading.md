# Learning Styles: An overview of theories, models, and measures

**6/10/17**

Hartley (1998 Hartley J 1998 Learning and studying: A research perspective London: Routledge
[Crossref], [Google Scholar]
) provides the following definitions: cognitive styles are the ways in which different individuals characteristically approach different cognitive tasks; learning styles are the ways in which individuals characteristically approach different learning tasks.

The four stages of the ELM are described as: concrete experience (CE; experiencing) which favours experiential learning; abstract conceptualisation (AC; thinking) where there is a preference for conceptual and analytical thinking in order to achieve understanding; active experimentation (AE; doing) involving active trial‐and‐error learning; and reflective observation (RO; reflecting) where extensive consideration is given to the task and potential solutions before there is any attempt at action.
