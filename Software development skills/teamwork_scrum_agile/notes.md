“Scrum is a framework for managing software development. Scrum is
designed for teams of approximately 10 individuals, and generally relies
on two-week development cycles, called "sprints", as well as short
daily stand-up meetings.” (Wikipedia, scrum, 2017)

# What is a user stories (in 2 minutes)

Many agile techniques use user stories

◦ Short descriptions of functionality told from user’s perspective that have value for a
user/customer

The most widely used template for writing user stories is from Coen (2004):

“As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.”

They can be written at varying levels of detail

◦ Large user stories are known as Epics

◦ These are split into multiple smaller user stories to complete in one iteration

◦ Related stories can also be organised into themes

Define acceptance criteria, each with a clear pass/fail result, to make the
story testable

Stories will need to prioritised

There are techniques for estimating effort for implementing stories
