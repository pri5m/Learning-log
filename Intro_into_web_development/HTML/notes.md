# Notes

**Linking between html pages**
```
  <div>
      <a href = "home.html" >Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
      <a href = "profile.html" >Profile</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
      <a href = "contact.html" >Contacts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
      <a href = "video.html" >Videos</a>&nbsp;
    </div> <br> <br>
```
**Non-breaking space**

The use of &nbsp (non-breaking space) 

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.

**Naming html pages**

Do not use capital letters at all. Avoid the use of numbers. Use underscores insted of spaces

computer_science is a good name

computerScience is not a good name, nor is Computer_science
