# Images
Correct
```
  <img src = "Shiro_NGNL.jpg" alt = "Shiro_fanart" width = "10%">
```
Did have 'scr' insted of the correct 'src'

Also image file already had .jpg at the end of the image name, but this was hidden for view. i didn't realise this so while I thought it said 'Shiro_NGNO.jpg', it was infact called 'Shiro_NGNO.jpg.jpg'. To correct this I changed the file settings by clicking on the 'view' tab in the file system and checking the box called *file name extensions*, revealing the already present .jpg. I then changed the file name, removing the unecessary .jpg that I had added manually.
