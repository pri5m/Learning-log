Not a replacement for Javascript

JS library- There is a syntax

jQuery is not a language, but it is a well written JavaScript code. As quoted on official jQuery website, "it is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development."

Selecting something, preforming an action on it
