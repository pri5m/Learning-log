# How (and where) could you construct dynamic content?

- Ask for webpage, construct webpage, run javascrpt goes to server, javascript used to manipulate the dom, puts content on the webpage

- HTML template loadup (one off thing), populate server side, server does all the route manipulation


**Discuss: pros and cons**

- client or server pay for time
