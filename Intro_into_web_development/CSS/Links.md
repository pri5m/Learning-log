CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS is a style language that defines layout of HTML documents. For example, CSS covers fonts, colours, margins, lines, height, width, background images, advanced positions and many other things. Just wait and see!

HTML can be (mis-)used to add layout to websites. But CSS offers more options and is more accurate and sophisticated. CSS is supported by all browsers today.

HTML is used to structure content. CSS is used for formatting structured content.

As the Web gained popularity, designers started looking for possibilities to add layout to online documents. To meet this demand, the browser producers (at that time Netscape and Microsoft) invented new HTML tags such as for example <font> which differed from the original HTML tags by defining layout - and not structure.

This also led to a situation where original structure tags such as <table> were increasingly being misused to layout pages instead of adding structure to text. Many new layout tags such as <blink> were only supported by one type of browser. "You need browser X to view this page" became a common disclaimer on web sites.

CSS was invented to remedy this situation by providing web designers with sophisticated layout opportunities supported by all browsers. At the same time, separation of the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, makes site maintenance a lot easier.

CSS was a revolution in the world of web design. The concrete benefits of CSS include:

- control layout of many documents from one single style sheet;
- more precise control of layout;
- apply different layout to different media-types (screen, print, etc.);
- numerous advanced and sophisticated techniques.

2)[How CSS works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works)

Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:

- A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
- A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.
- A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.
