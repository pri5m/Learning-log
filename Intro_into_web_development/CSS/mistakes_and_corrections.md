# Linking CSS into HTML

```
<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "Profile_styling.css">
```

I had the code correct as well as the file name and location. However the file was set to open with notebook insted of Atom, this caused the HTML file not to be able to locate the CSS file, as it was trying to open it in notebook, which clearly would not work. The fix was to set the CSS file to open with Atom.
