**What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

**Classifying Type Systems**

Type systems are commonly classified by several words, of which the most common are "static," "dynamic," "strong," and "weak." In this section, I address the more common kinds of classification. Some are useful, and some are not.

**Strong and Weak Typing**

Probably the most common way type systems are classified is "strong" or "weak." This is unfortunate, since these words have nearly no meaning at all. It is, to a limited extent, possible to compare two languages with very similar type systems, and designate one as having the stronger of those two systems. Beyond that, the words mean nothing at all.

Therefore: I give the following general definitions for strong and weak typing, at least when used as absolutes:

Strong typing: A type system that I like and feel comfortable with
Weak typing: A type system that worries me, or makes me feel uncomfortable
What about when the phrase is used in a more limited sense? Then strong typing, depending on the speaker or author, may mean anything on the spectrum from "static" to "sound," both of which are defined below.

**Static and Dynamic Types**

This is very nearly the only common classification of type systems that has real meaning. As a matter of fact, it's significance is frequently under-estimated. I realize that may sound ridiculous; but this theme will recur throughout this article. Dynamic and static type systems are two completely different things, whose goals happen to partially overlap.

A static type system is a mechanism by which a compiler examines source code and assigns labels (called "types") to pieces of the syntax, and then uses them to infer something about the program's behavior. A dynamic type system is a mechanism by which a compiler generates code to keep track of the sort of data (coincidentally, also called its "type") used by the program. The use of the same word "type" in each of these two systems is, of course, not really entirely coincidental; yet it is best understood as having a sort of weak historical significance. Great confusion results from trying to find a world view in which "type" really means the same thing in both systems. It doesn't. The better way to approach the issue is to recognize that:

Much of the time, programmers are trying to solve the same problem with static and dynamic types.
Nevertheless, static types are not limited to problems solved by dynamic types.
Nor are dynamic types limited to problems that can be solved with static types.
At their core, these two techniques are not the same thing at all.
