    <p> ... but this is written in html?!?<br>
      open the console in the browser to see the js output</p>
    <script>
      console.log('Hello World');
      console.log('Hello World');
      console.log('Hello World');

**Problems with using console.log**

- Takes longer to execute

- Tend to use it as a debug tool but is visible to everyone who visits the page. Should be careful

# Basics

- camelCase

- Semicolons at the end ofeach statement line

- Indentation not strict (but do it anyway)
